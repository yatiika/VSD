Week 5 
Short Summary:
Steps i followed :
I cloned and installed the OpenROAD Flow Scripts repository on my Linux system, set up all necessary dependencies, and 
verified the environment by launching the `flow.tcl` interface. Then, I ran the design flow up to the floorplan and 
placement stages, confirming successful generation of the core/die area and proper standard-cell placement. 

Challenges i faced: 
Initially, I faced dependency errors and missing library paths, which I resolved by reinstalling required packages and 
updating the environment variables.
